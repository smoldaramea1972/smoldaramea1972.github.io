unique instruments and effects for Ableton Live including drum machines, samples, synth presets, FX and much more ðŸŽ‰ See a full list of whatâ€™s included below. 99Sounds â€“ Upright Piano. Upright Piano is a free VST piano plugin based on a set of piano samples recorded by Rudi Fiasco. There are a fairly low amount of features available in this plugin, but the quality is very bright and clean, especially for a free plugin. Grand Piano's 1.5 GB of samples are grouped into 12 pure piano presets in 'Production' and more detailed 'Solo' versions (both available in stretched and equal tempered tunings), as well as nine hybrid presets that combine the acoustic piano samples with a selection of synthesizers and effects.</p><p>Piano VSTs are a songwriterâ€™s best friend. The piano is one of the best instruments to use for writing, arranging and producing music.</p><p>Thatâ€™s why a great sounding piano plugin is a helpful and inspiring tool in almost every genre.</p><p>Those inspiring sounds lead to creating better music.</p><p>There are tons of piano plugins out there, but most of them are expensive. The top picks can cost a fortune.</p><p>But you donâ€™t have to spend big money to get a great sound.</p><p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m rounding up the 10 best free piano VSTs that will give you an inspiring acoustic piano tone in your DAW.</p><h2>1. Spitfire Audio LABS Soft Piano</h2><p>Spitfire LABS contains some of the best free plugin instruments available.</p><p>LABS is an ongoing series of free software instruments made by musicians and sampling experts in London. Itâ€™s updated with new sounds constantly and sports an easy to use user interface.</p><p>Their soft piano plugin is still a go-to piano sound for many professional composers. Some musicians have actually used this free VST plugin to write entire albums of solo piano music</p><p>Soft piano delivers a warm, solemn tone. This sampled instrument was recorded with a thin strip of felt between the hammers and the strings for an evocative sound.</p><h2>2. Ivy Audio Piano in 162</h2><p>Piano in 162 is a sample library of a Steinway Model B grand piano made with a comprehensive sampling approach. The library includes two round robins, five dynamic levels, and separate pedal on/off samples.</p><p>Round robins are the number of different samples per note. The plugin will select a random sample each time the note is played, contributing to the realism of the sound.</p><p>Round robins are the number of different samples per note. The plugin will select a random sample each time the note is played, contributing to the realism of the sound.</p><p>Piano in 162 was recorded at 96kHz through two pairs of Rode NT5 cardioid microphonesâ€”an ambient pair in the hall and a close pair inside the piano.</p><p>Youâ€™ll need a sampler to run this library. Piano in 162 is compatible with the full version of Kontakt, or on Plogue Sforzando which runs .sfz files. Sfz files are text files that store instrument data for software synthesizers.</p><h2>3. Prism Audio Atmos Piano</h2><p>Atmos Piano is a perfect piano plugin if youâ€™re looking for that dreamy, distant sound. Itâ€™s perfect for intimate ambiences, or a cinematic bed.</p><p>Atmos is a robust 2.4 GB library with 241 different samples. There are two separate microphone sources that can blend together with decay and release parameters.</p><p>If youâ€™re looking to create an atmospheric, ambient piano soundscape, then this piano plugin is a perfect choice.</p><h2>4. Keyzone Classic</h2><p>Keyzone Classic is an all-round piano plugin. This sample based plugin is capable of replicating some of the most sought after piano brands.</p><p>The presets include Yamaha and Steinway grand pianos, as well as electric piano and Rhodes.</p><p>Keyzone Classic also sports common parameters you would find on a synthesizer. ADSR, and an LFO able to affect pitch, expression, and pan can allow you to shape a unique piano sound.</p><p>With its incredible sound shaping parameters, thereâ€™s no question why Keyzone Classic is often recommended as a go-to free piano VST.</p><img src='https://rekkerd.org/img/articles/shoenhut_toy_piano.jpg' alt='Grand' title='Grand'><h2>5. Versilian Studios Upright No. 1</h2><p>Versilian Upright No. 1 is billed as a lightweight sketching plugin, but definitely sells itself short. Itâ€™s an excellent representation of a classic upright piano.</p><p>This upright piano VST was sampled using wide and close mics. Like Keyzone Classic, Versilian Upright offers ADSR controls as well as built in reverb and panning.</p><p>The intensive sampling of this plugin includes 3 velocity layers with 2 round robins; sampled in tritones with a pair of wide, close mics. The samples include full decays of up to 30 seconds, which allow for great versatility when you use a sustain pedal.</p><p>Versilian Upright No. 1 is a go-to upright piano vst that will bring authenticity to your music.</p><h2>6. Soundmagic Piano One</h2><p>Soundmagic Piano One comes from the sampling of a Yamaha C7 concert grand. It uses its own hybrid modelling engine to capture the well known sound of the C7.</p><p>This engine combines the realistic sound of sampling and the playability of modelling. The playability is responsive due to the modelling while the sampling makes the sound crisp and realistic.</p><p>The user interface includes an absurd amount of controls for a piano VST. It allows you to customize just about anything. Interesting features include piano noises, audience and player perspective, and tuning systems.</p><p>Lexmark x8350 <a href='/lexmark-x8350-printer-driver-for-windows-10.html'>printer</a> driver for windows 10.

It features four sampled notes per octave and six dynamic layers per sampled note.</p><p>99Sounda Upright piano features a simple interface with ADSR, volume, and reverb controls.</p><p>What makes this VST a bit different is that it includes filter and tremolo control. If youâ€™re looking to create a vintage lofi sound inside of a plugin, this oneâ€™s for you.</p><h2>8. 4Front R-Piano</h2><p>4Front R-Piano is a bit different then most of the sample based plugins on this list. R-Piano is inspired by RSP73 pianos, a popular discontinued electric piano plugin.</p><p>R-piano generates 127 different layers continuously, under a vintage overdrive. You wonâ€™t have worry about common sample library issues like CPU load or stuck notes with R-piano.</p><p>While this piano VST doesnâ€™t exactly emulate a realistic piano, it can work well as an alternative to the Rhodes electric pianos</p><h2>9. DSK The Grand</h2><p>DSK The Grand is a lightweight plugin at just 51 MB in size. If youâ€™re low on space and need a piano plugin to finish your track, then this piano VST is for you.</p><p>It contains 4 velocity layers, with 4-6 samples per note. The user interface is simply laid out containing ADSR controls, and a reverb.</p><p>By tweaking the release parameter and using the on-board reverb, you can get this small plugin sounding huge.</p><h2>10. Bigcat Instruments Iowa Grand Piano</h2><p>Bigcat Instruments Iowa Grand Piano is the free piano plugin you want if youâ€™re looking for absolute realism. Iowa Grand Piano is a Steinway &amp; Sons Grand recorded with a pair of Neumann KM 84 microphones. Itâ€™s hard to believe that this one is free.</p><p>Most piano VSTâ€™s are sampled every third note to save space for round robins and velocity layers. Iowa Grand Piano includes virtually every note of the piano with three velocity layers.</p><h3>Ableton Grand Piano Free Download 64-bit</h3><img src='https://x3i4u3r4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dark-silence-grand-piano-vst-hero-image-jpg.jpg' alt='64-bit' title='64-bit'><p>The individual samples are available for download, and exist in the public domain.
