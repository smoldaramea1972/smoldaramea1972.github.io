In this post, we would like to share some important information about 4K Blu-ray Playback.</p><h3>Part 1: Conditions Required for 4K Blu-ray Playback</h3><p>To watch 4K Blu-ray Movies, UHD Blu-ray and Blu-ray UHD, there are actually 2 ways: make use of Blu-ray 4K player software and Blu-ray player 4K hardware. To play 4K Blu-ray movies on computer, there are some requirements to your computer equipment. You need Intel Core i7 2.3GHz four-core processor and NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M video card. It also requires 8GB RAM, 7200rpm hard drive or SSD for media. To get the best visual effect, you also need a 4K resolution monitor.
