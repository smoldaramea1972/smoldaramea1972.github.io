However, one thing holding me back is parting with the wealth of instruments I've accumulated for use with my Cakewalk DAW's.<br>I found Sonar and Cakewalk to be robust, stable, and more than adequate for my needs. But it feels like a large footprint, creating folders all over my hard drive. It also requires Command Center and BandLab Assistant to download all the necessary goods. Meanwhile, Studio One is faster, simpler, and cleaner -- possibly much more to my style.<br>So I would like to use my Cakewalk VST's with Studio One, as it doesn't seem to have as much variety as I hoped. I attempted this by dragging Sonar's VST folders (Sound Center, TTS-1, Studio Instruments Suite, Session Drummer) into Presonus' respective VST folder.<br>To my astonishment, all those plugins seemed to work fine..<em>until I uninstalled Cakewalk</em>. It seems those plugins have a dependency on their former location (which no longer exists). I'm frustrated and disappointed -- and skeptical of Studio One's claim to support third-party VST's.<br>Although I'm sure Studio One possibly offers all the instruments I need, I'd love to be able to use Cakewalk's VST plugins there also. Is this <em>at all</em> possible? In the meantime, I'm trying to sway myself to just <em>dive</em> into Studio One, enjoy it to the fullest, and leave the Cakewalk mess of software behind..<br>Any insight to this conundrum would be much appreciated! </div><div><strong>Presonus Studio One 4 Professional</strong> (Windows 10)<br>Intel I7-6700K (Asus Maximus VIII GENE)<br>Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 SSD (1TB)<br>G.Skill DDR4-3000 RAM (16GB) </div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><ul><li><span> Posts: 2568</span></li><li> Offline <ul><li><span><strong> Posts :</strong> 2568</span></li><li><span><strong> Joined :</strong> Wed Jul 02, 2014 9:37 am</span></li><li><span><strong>Has thanked:</strong>5 times</span></li><li><span><strong>Been thanked:</strong>247 times</span></li></ul></li></ul></td><td><div>You only have to point S1 to where the VST's are installed, no need to move them anywhere.<br>Settings locations</div><div><strong>Forum Moderator.<br>Please add your specs to your <span>SIGNATURE</span>.<br>Search the <span>STUDIO ONE 5 ONLINE MANUAL</span>.

Now, switching the focus to the other aspect of this topic: making the switch to Studio One..<br><strong>PREFACE:<br>I'm an amateur music composer who doesn't sing or play instruments. All my projects are composed straight from my PC, using only software VST's, synths, etc.</strong><br>I purchased Cakewalk Music Creator some years ago, later moving onto Sonar Artist and Cakewalk by Bandlab. I've begun several song projects there and I now worry that I might have trouble migrating these projects to Studio One. So, I currently have Sonar Artist, Cakewalk by BandLab and Studio One v4.<br>Second notable fact: The Cakewalk DAW offers an <em>enormous</em> variety of instruments. There's TTS-1, Studio Instruments Suite, Session Drummer 3, and Cakewalk Sound Center. (Also the several Digital Sound Factory instrument libraries I purchased for Sound Center.) I have access to at least 2,000 instruments across the board (including the drum kits). I've sampled almost all the Studio One instrument sounds and feel a bit hesitant considering SO4's instrument library isn't nearly as diverse. I'm trying to convince myself that Studio One's instrument library is more than adequate.<br>Those are just a few reasons why I'm having trouble with this decision. Other reasons include, in brief:<br>1) Sonar and Cakewalk take longer to start up when starting into a project<br>2) Sonar and Cakewalk create folders all over my hard drive (bigger footprint)<br>3) Cakewalk requires an Assistant to install add-ons and an app to install Cakewalk by BandLab<br>4) Sonar and Cakewalk seem to have a deeper learning curve and every function is more involved<br>In regards to Studio One:<br>1) It's just simpler and cleaner, less of a learning curve<br>2) It's a clearer resolution when upscaled 125%<br>3) It starts up quickly and is more responsive<br>(I think my biggest issue in switching is plainly that Sonar/Cakewalk have lots, <em>lots </em>more instruments.)<br>I'm thinking aloud, still struggling to decide if I'm ready to leave Cakewalk behind. I know I have to make the decision myself, but any other outside opinions are certainly welcome! </div><div> Last edited by Grundberg on Tue Mar 03, 2020 9:32 pm, edited 1 time in total. </div><div><strong>Presonus Studio One 4 Professional</strong> (Windows 10)<br>Intel I7-6700K (Asus Maximus VIII GENE)<br>Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 SSD (1TB)<br>G.Skill DDR4-3000 RAM (16GB) </div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><ul><li><span> Posts: 1858</span></li><li> Offline <ul><li><span><strong> Posts :</strong> 1858</span></li><li><span><strong> Joined :</strong> Tue Jul 01, 2014 8:45 pm</span></li><li><span><strong>Has thanked:</strong>159 times</span></li><li><span><strong>Been thanked:</strong>295 times</span></li></ul></li></ul></td><td><div>Well, you don't have to exclusively use one or the other.
