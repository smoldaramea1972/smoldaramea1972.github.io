Research on anti-crack and crack width calculation method of high strength concrete beams with high strength reinforcement. In: Proceedings of the 2nd Seminar of High Strength Concrete and Application. Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 1995, 147–154. Reinforcement for Slabs-on ground for Crack Width Control Only. There are two factors based on which the crack width can be controlled by reinforcement. These are the joint spacing and the thickness of the slab. Or we can tell the crack width control is a function of joint space and slab thickness.</p>Skip to end of metadataGo to start of metadata<p>In ETABS, shell or area element has two types of stiffnesses i.e. inplane stiffness refers as f11, f22 and f12 and out-of-plane stiffness refers as m11, m22 and m12. Refer to the below Figure which shows the direction of local axes and their corresponding stiffnesses:</p><p>For shear wall (both piers and spandrels), the flexural and axial behavior is modified by either f11 or f22 depending on the orientation of the local axis and the shear behavior is controlled by f12. In column and code terms f11 or f22 would correspond to modifications of EI or EA and f12 would correspond to modifications to GA<sub>shear</sub>. The code recommendations in Section 10.10 of ACI 318 code are related to slenderness effects where flexural deformations govern so they have recommended modifying EI (corresponding to f11 or f22 for shear walls). There is no recommendation about reducing the GA<sub>shear</sub>. You should, however, note that some of our users use modifiers for f12 also, where they expect deterioration of shear stiffness and want to be realistic in their modeling.</p><p>The above discussion applies assuming the local axes 1 and 2 of the shear wall area object are either vertical or horizontal. This is under user control. When drawing in ETABS the default is to have the 1 axis horizontal and the 2 axis vertical. This means that the flexural modifier for EI should be applied to f22 for wall piers and to f11 for spandrels. If you apply the modifier to both f11 and f22 it hardly affects the results.</p><p>For slabs where bending is always in the out-of-plane direction, modifiers m11, m22 and m12 are required to model cracking behavior.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Assuming beams and columns are modeled as frame then the stiffness modifier table is as follows:</p><p>ACI ETABS</p><p>Beams....................0.35*Ig I22 = I33 = 0.35</p><p>Columns..................0.70*Ig I22 = I33 = 0.70</p><p>Walls-Uncracked.........0.70*Ig modeled as shell – f11, f22 = 0.70 </p><p>Walls-Cracked...........0.35*Ig similar to Walls-Uncracked (with modifiers of 0.35)</p><p>NOTE:</p><p>Walls are generally not designed for out-of-plane bending to avoid excessive longitudinal reinforcement. In this case, use a small modifier say 0.1 for m11, m22 and m12 so numerical instabilities could be avoided. However, use m11, m22, m12 = 0.70 (or 0.35) when considering the out-of-plane bending in wall.</p><p>Flat Plates &amp; Flat Slabs..0.25*Ig modeled as membrane – f11, f22, f12 = 0.25 / modeled as shell – f11, f22, f12, m11, m22, m12 = 0.25 (for both cases fxx is not important if rigid diaphragm is assigned)</p><h2><madcap:conditionaltext>Concrete Member</madcap:conditionaltext> - Design</h2><p><madcap:conditionaltext>Concrete</madcap:conditionaltext> design and optimization can be performed for <madcap:conditionaltext>standard</madcap:conditionaltext> concrete shapes based on the following codes:</p><ul><li value='1'>The 2019, 2014, 2011, 2008, 2005, 2002 and 1999 Editions of ACI 318</li><li value='2'>The 1997 Edition of the British code (BS 8110)</li><li value='3'>The 1992 EuroCode (EC2) and the British publication of the 2014 and 2004 Eurocode (BSEN)</li><li value='4'>The 1994 and 2004 Editions of the Canadian code (CSA A23.3)</li><li value='5'>The 2000 Edition of the Indian code (IS 456)</li><li value='6'>The 2001 Edition of the Australian code (AS 3600)</li><li value='7'>The 1995 Edition of the New Zealand code (NZS 3101)</li><li value='8'>The 2004 Edition of the Mexican code (NTC-DF)</li><li value='9'>The 2007 Edition of the Saudi Building Code (SBC 304)</li></ul><p><b>Note:</b></p><ul><li value='1'>Unless otherwise specified, all code references below are to ACI 318-14.</li><li value='2'>Beams and Columns designed in RISA meet all of the requirements for Ordinary Moment Frames except for the additional requirements indicated in ACI 318-14 Section 18.3.

The K-factor approximation is based on the idealized tables given in the AISC steel specification.

You can always override a K-value after an approximation by directly entering the value that you want in the appropriate field. Keep in mind that a subsequent approximation will overwrite any manually input values so you will need to override the approximation each time it is performed.</span></p><p><span>Limitation:</span></p><p><span>RISA</span>-<span>3D</span><span> will currently neglect the influence of adjoining framing members when those members are connected at a joint that also has degrees of freedom restrained by boundary conditions. For example, suppose a column and beam member connect at a joint that is restrained for translation in </span><span>all</span><span> directions (I.e. the joint is “pinned”). The K factor approximation will neglect the beam member when it calculates the K factor for the column and vice versa. The effect will be that the ends of the members at that joint will be seen as “pinned” and not “fixed” for the K-factor approximation.</span></p><h6><span>Sway Flags</span></h6><p>The <b>Sway Flags</b> indicate whether the member is to be considered subject to sidesway for bending <span>about its local y and z axes</span>. The <b>y</b><b> sway</b> field is for <span>y-y axis</span> bending and the <b>z</b><b> sway</b> field is for <span>z-z axis bending</span>. Click on the field to check the box and indicate that the member is subject to sway for that particular direction, or leave the entry blank if the member is braced against sway. These sway flags influence the calculation of the K Factors as well as the Cm.</p><h6><span>Cm – Equivalent Moment Correction Factor</span></h6><p>The <b>Cm Coefficients</b> are used to check the column for Euler buckling, and for the Moment Magnification Procedure in older editions of the ACI code. <b>Cm-</b><span>yy</span> is for bending <span>about the columns's local y-y axis</span> and <b>Cm-</b><span>zz</span> is for bending <span>about the local z-z axis</span>.

Therefore, this value will be ignored if the corresponding sway flag is checked.</p><h6><span>Flexural and Shear Rebar Layout</span></h6><p><span>The user may choose to manually create the reinforcement layout for the column. This must be done if the user wishes to take advantage of bundled bars, multiple layers of reinforcement, or an unequal number of bars per face. See the section on the Concrete Database and Rebar Layouts for more information. If 'Default' is specified, then the program will design for an equal number of bars in each face of the rectangular column and may vary that reinforcing based on ACI minimums, maximums and the moment and shear demand at each section along the span. </span></p><h6><span>Icr Factors (Cracked Moment of Inertia Factors)</span></h6><p>The <b>Icr Factor</b> is used to reduce the bending stiffness of concrete columns per ACI 318-14 Table 6.6.3.1.1(a) (ACI 318-11 Section 10.10.4.1).

As described in the previous section, RISA uses the <b>Icr Factor</b> to account for this stiffness reduction. However, for service level analysis, the level of cracking will be significantly less. Therefore, the stiffness used in your analysis should be representative of the reduced loading and reduced cracking. Per the ACI 318-14 Section R6.6.3.2.2 (ACI 318-11 Section R10.10.4.1), the program will account for this increased stiffness by applying a factor of 1.43 to the cracked section properties for any load combination that has the <b>“Service Load”</b> flag checked on the <b>Design</b> tab of the <b>Load Combinations Spreadsheet</b>.</span></p><p><span>Note</span></p><h4><span>Concrete Design Parameters - Beams</span></h4><p>The <b>Concrete</b><b> Beam</b> tab on the <b>Members</b><b> Spreadsheet</b> records the design parameters for the code checks of concrete beams.

This must be done if the user wishes to take advantage of compression steel, or multiple layers of reinforcement. See Concrete Database - Rebar Layouts for more information. If <i>Use Design Rule</i> is specified, then the program will design for one layer of reinforcing and may vary that reinforcing based on ACI minimums, maximums, and the moment and shear demand at each section along the span using the Member Design Rules as the parameters of the reinforcement selection. If you define your own rebar layout, and compression reinforcement is defined, then the program will consider the compression reinforcement in the analysis.</span></p><h6><span>Icr Factors (Cracked Moment of Inertia Factors)</span></h6><p>The <b>Icr Factor</b> is used to reduce the bending stiffness of concrete beams. </p><p>For ACI and Canadian codes (ACI 318-14 Section 6.6.3.1 and A23.3-04 section 9.2.1.2), if this entry is left blank, the Icr factor will default to a value of 0.35 for beams and 0.70 for columns.</p><p>For Australian and New Zealand codes (per section 6.6.2 of AS3600-2001), this will default to a value of 0.4 for beams and 0.8 for columns. </p><p>For Indian and Saudi codes, this entry will default to a value of 1.0 for beams and columns.</p><p><span>Note</span></p><ul><li value='1'>The <b>Icr Factor</b> will be ignored if the <b>“Use Cracked Stiffness”</b> box is not checked on the <b>Concrete</b> tab of the <b>Model Settings</b> dialog. </li></ul><h6><span>Service Level Stiffness</span></h6><p><span>Due to cracking and material non-linearity, modeling the stiffness of concrete</span><span> members is more complex than it is for steel or wood members.</span></p><p><span>For typical applications, ACI 318-14 Section 6.6.3.1 (ACI 318-11 Section 10.10.4) requires that member stiffness be reduced to account for the cracking that occurs when a member is subjected to ultimate level loads. As described in the previous section, RISA uses the <b>Icr Factor</b> to account for this stiffness reduction. However, for service level analysis, the level of cracking will be significantly less. Therefore, the stiffness used in your analysis should be representative of the reduced loading and reduced cracking. Per ACI 318-14 Section R6.6.3.1.1 (ACI 318-11 Section R10.10.4.1), the program will account for this increased stiffness by applying a factor of 1.43 to the cracked section properties for any load combination that has the <b>“Service Load”</b> flag checked on the <b>Design</b> tab of the <b>Load Combinations Spreadsheet</b>.</span></p><p><span>Note</span></p><h4>T-beam &amp; L-beam Sections</h4><p><span><b>T-beams</b> and <b>L-beams</b> may be specified by assigning effective slab widths and slab thicknesses for the left and right side of the beam on the <b>Concrete Beam</b> tab of the <b>Members Spreadsheet</b>. These modifications may also be made graphically via the <b>Modify Properties</b> tab of the <b>Draw Members</b> tool.</span></p><p>RISA-<span>3D</span> will automatically trim the effective slab widths, <b>B-eff Left</b> and <b>B-eff Right</b>, to the maximum values indicated in ACI 318-14 Table 6.3.2.1 (ACI 318-11 Sections 8.12.2(a) and 8.12.3(a) &amp; (b)) if the value entered by the user is greater than that allowed by the code. It should be noted that RISA-<span>3D</span> does not check ACI 318-14 Table 6.3.2.1 portions referring to adjacent framing (ACI 318-11 Sections 8.12.2(b) and 8.12.3(c)) because no adjacent framing checks are performed.</p><p><span>I</span><span>f the values of either <b>B-eff Left</b> or <b>B-eff Right</b> are left blank, a value of zero will be assumed, indicating no additional slab width beyond 1/2 the beam width on that side.</span></p><p>Note:</p><ul><li value='1'>B-eff Right corresponds to the positive local z-axis of the beam. Subsequently, B-eff Left corresponds to the negative local z-axis.</li></ul><h4>Parabolic vs. Rectangular Stress Blocks</h4><p><span>You can specify whether you want your concrete design to be performed with a rectangular stress block, or with a more accurate parabolic stress block. While most hand calculations are performed using a rectangular stress block, the parabolic stress block is more accurate. In fact, most of the PCA design aids are based upon the parabolic stress distribution. A good reference on the parabolic stress block is the PCA Notes on ACI 318-99.</span></p><h4><span>Biaxial Bending of Columns</span></h4><p><span>You can specify whether you want your column design to be performed by using <b>Exact Integration</b>, or by using the <b>PCA Load Contour Method</b>. While most hand calculations are performed using the Load Contour Method, this method is merely an approximation based on the uniaxial failure conditions and the Parme Beta factor. In contrast, the Exact Integration method uses the true biaxial strain state to design the member. A good reference on the Load Contour Method is chapter 12 of the PCA Notes on ACI 318-99.</span></p><h4>British Eurocode Design Parameters (BS EN 1992-1-1: 2004)</h4><h6>General</h6><ul><li value='1'>f’<sub>ck</sub> – Can not be more than 50 MPa (7252 psi) for normal strength concrete</li><li value='2'>α<sub>cc</sub> is assumed to be 1 (recommended value) : See 3.1.6</li><li value='3'>Effective length of T and L: L<sub>o</sub>=.7*span length and b<sub>eff</sub>,i =L<sub>o</sub>/10</li><li value='4'>φ<sub>concrete</sub> = 1.5</li><li value='5'>φ<sub>rebar</sub> = 1.15</li><li value='6'>Maximum bar spacing for beams = 300 mm</li></ul><h6>Tension Development Length</h6><ul><li value='1'><p>α<sub>ct</sub>= 1 (assumed in Eq 3.16)</p></li><li value='2'><p>η<sub>1</sub>= η<sub>2</sub>=1 (assumed in Eq 8.2 to calculate bond stress)</p></li><li value='3'><p>λ<sub>3</sub>, λ<sub>5</sub>, λ<sub>4</sub>=1 (assumed in Eq 8.4)</p></li><li value='4'><p>C<sub>d</sub> in Table 8.2 assumed to be 1 bar diameter rebar spacing</p></li><li value='5'><p>Development length when hooks are provided uses same assumptions as BS 8110-1: 1997</p></li></ul><h6>Shear Capacity of Concrete</h6><p>To compute the shear capacity of concrete the following recommended values are being used:</p><ul><li value='1'><p>C<sub>Rd,c</sub> =0.18/γ<sub>c</sub> for Eq 6.2.a</p></li><li value='2'><p>v<sub>min</sub> =0.035 k<sup>3/2</sup> f<sub>ck</sub><sup>1/2</sup></p></li><li value='3'><p>ν =.6*[1- f<sub>ck</sub> /250]</p></li><li value='4'><p>V<sub>max</sub> is calculated from Eq. 6.5.</p></li><li value='5'><p>θ is assumed 45 degrees in Eq 6.8.</p></li></ul><h6>Slender Column Design</h6><ul><li value='1'><p>Biaxial column design done using Eq. 5.39</p></li><li value='2'>Design based on nominal curvature</li><li value='3'><p>λ<sub>lim</sub> = 20 A B C/n<sup>1/2</sup> (A=.7, B= 1.1, C=0.7 for unbraced)</p></li><li value='4'><p>K<sub>ϕ</sub> =1 in Eq 5.34; the effect of creep is neglected.</p></li></ul><h4><span>Limitations - General</span></h4><p><span>Torsion</span> – Beams<madcap:conditionaltext> and columns</madcap:conditionaltext> ignore torsion with respect to the design of shear reinforcement.

This is shown on the detail report.</p><h4><span>Limitations - ACI</span></h4><p><span>Shear Design</span> –When ACI 318-19 is selected, the shear strength of concrete (Vc) uses equations in Table 22.5.5.1. Note that for members meeting the minimum shear reinforcement requirement (Av≥Av,min), Vc is taken as the larger of the results calculated by the equations (a) and (b) in the table. ACI 318-19 code suggests ρw may be taken as the sum of the areas of longitudinal bars located more than two-thirds of the overall member depth away from the extreme compression ﬁber. Therefore, RISA calculates ρw as the sum of the areas of longitudinal bars on the tension face.</p><p> When other ACI 318 editions are selected, the shear strength of the concrete alone is limited to the standard 2*λ*sqrt (f'c) equation from ACI 318-14 Section 22.5.5.1 (ACI 318-11 Section 11.2.1.1) and does not use the more detailed calculations of ACI 318-14 Table 22.5.5.1 (ACI 318-11 Section 11.2.2). Also, note that for members with significant axial tension (greater than 0) the program designs the shear reinforcement to carry the total shear per ACI 318-14 Section R22.5.7.1 (ACI 318-11 Section 11.2.1.3).</p><p><b>Deep Beam Design</b> – The program does not design deep beams as defined in ACI 318-14 Section 9.9.1.1(a) (ACI 318-11 Section 10.7).</p><p><madcap:conditionaltext><b>Threshold Torsion</b> - The program does not adjust the threshold torsion value for the presence of axial force in a beam, though it does do this for columns.</madcap:conditionaltext><a href='/doli-saja-ke-episodes.html'>/doli-saja-ke-episodes.html</a>.</p><h4><span>Limitations - Canadian Code</span></h4><p><span>Concrete Stress Profile </span><span>– </span> Concrete stress strain curve (parabolic) is assumed same as PCA method for the Canadian codes.</p><p><span>Bi-Axial Bending</span> - The program uses the simplified uniaxial solution provided in the Canadian specification rather than performing a complete biaxial condition.</p><p><b>Mid-Depth Flexural Strain for Shear Design</b> - The program uses the code equation (per the General Method) to calculate <span>e</span><span>x</span>with the moment and shear at the section taken from the envelope diagrams.

There are also instances where a code check is performed, but the results may be suspect as a provision of the design code was violated. In these cases, results are provided so that they can be examined to find the cause of the problem. Following are the messages that may be seen.</p><h6><span>No Load Combinations for Concrete Design have been run.</span></h6><p><madcap:conditionaltext>None</madcap:conditionaltext> of the load combinations that were run had the <b>Concrete Design</b> box checked on <madcap:conditionaltext>the <b>Design</b> tab of </madcap:conditionaltext>the <b>Load Combinations Spreadsheet</b>.
