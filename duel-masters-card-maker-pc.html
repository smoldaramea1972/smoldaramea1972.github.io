2012, Wizards of the Coast relaunched Duel Masters under a new franchise named “Kaijudo: Rise of the Duel Masters”. Based on the existing Duel Masters brand, Kaijudo features an online game, trading card game, and a television series. The product was canceled a second time in 2014.</p><dt>Duel Masters Trading Card Game</dt><table cellspacing='5'><caption>Duel Masters Trading Card Game</caption><tbody><tr><th scope='row'>Designer(s)</th><td>Mike Elliott, Charlie Catano, and Tyler Bielman</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Publisher(s)</th><td>Wizards of the Coast</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Players</th><td>2 or 4</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Age range</th><td>10+</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Playing time</th><td>Approx 20 min</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Random chance</th><td>Some</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Skill(s) required</th><td>Card playing<br>Arithmetic<br>Basic Reading Ability<br>Strategy</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <i><b>Duel Masters Trading Card Game</b></i> is a two-player or 2 vs. 2 team collectible card game (CCG) jointly developed by Wizards of the Coast, Shogakukan, and Mitsui &amp; Co. The card game is part of the <i>Duel Masters</i> franchise.</p><p>The game was released in Japan in May 2002, where it quickly became the number one selling trading card game for over a year.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup> Due to this popularity, it was released in the United States on March 5, 2004. The game shares several similarities with <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, the world's first collectible card game which was also published by Wizards of the coast. In fact, <i>Duelmasters</i> was originally intended as an alternative and a mind game<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup> tradename for <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> and the earlier game play was abandoned in the <i>Duel Masters</i> manga plot to promote this latest experience.</p><p>As in <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, <i>Duel Masters</i> players summon creatures and cast spells using mana. Key differences include the fact that all creatures and spells can act as mana producers, creatures cannot block attacking creatures without having the 'blocker' ability, and that creatures only have one 'power' statistic. Furthermore, duelists have shields in the form of cards that go to their hand when 'broken' as opposed to <i>Magic'</i>s 'life points'. Due to the popularity of Duel Masters, four video games (three released for the Game Boy Advance and the other for the PS2) based around the game have been produced, titled <i>Duel Masters: Kaijudo Showdown</i>, <i>Duel Masters: Sempai Legends</i>, <i>Duel Masters: Shadow of the Code</i> for the GBA and <i>Duel Masters: Cobalt</i> for the PS2.</p><p>Fans of <i>Duel Masters</i> around the world support player-organized tournaments and also unofficial national championships. The community centers around 2 main forums internationally which contain translations for Japanese cards. Because Duel Masters is the most successful TCG in all Asia, a new booster set is released every two months, and new theme decks every three months.</p><p>As of December 2006, the English sets of Duel Masters has been discontinued by Wizards of the Coast due to weak sales and is now being hosted by Takara Tomy in Japan.<sup><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></sup></p><p>It is rumoured that the game might return with the start of the new Duel Masters anime series 'Kaijudo The Rise of the Duel Masters'.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><ul><li><span>1</span><span>Game Play</span></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span>Game Play</span></h2><div class='lYI'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMMllnlZziY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>In <i>Duel Masters</i>, two players play the role of duelists, using the 'art' of 'kaijudo' (a marketing term created for the North American version which supposedly describes the 'art of battling with giant monsters' <sup><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></sup> to bring their creatures to life to do battle. Players battle each other by placing cards into their respective 'mana zones', then using that mana to summon creatures into the battle zone or cast spells.</p><p>Each player has 5 shields that protect them from damage; once these are gone, it takes one successful attack to win the duel. Also, if a player has no more cards to draw from his/her deck, that player automatically loses the duel.</p><h3><span>Types of Cards</span></h3><ul><li><b>Creatures</b>: Creatures are the most important cards in the game. Creatures are summoned into the battle zone by paying their mana cost. They can attack your opponents creatures, shields or the opponent himself. Breaking all of your opponents shields and then attacking the opponent is how you win the game. Creatures that have been summoned usually have summoning sickness and cannot attack in the same turn (with exception to evolution creatures and creatures with card effects like Speed Attacker).</li></ul><ul><li><b>Evolution Creatures</b>: These are put on top of the creatures, or 'evolved'. These cards generally have higher powers and better effects than normal creatures. Usually, evolution creatures have 'double-breaker' or 'triple-breaker' effects which allow them to break more shields than normal creatures. Evolution creatures made their debut in the 'Evo-Crushinators of Doom' set. Evolution creatures also have a wide range of mana costs, ranging from costs of 2 mana, 'Barkwhip, the Smasher' to 10 mana, [Dorballom, Lord of Demons]. Overall, Evolution Creatures are a good way to quickly attack and gain an advantage over your opponent as an Evolution Creature can attack on the turn they are summoned as they do not suffer from Summoning Sickness.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Spells</b>: When cast, spells have an effect on either player's cards in their hand, graveyard (discard pile), mana zone or summoned creatures/cross gears and after their effect is used, they are placed into the graveyard. Some spells have special effects like 'Cyclone' and 'Charger' which sends the spell back to the player's hand or mana zone respectively. Spells can also have many other abilities such as 'Double Evolution Burst', 'Knight Magic' or 'Launcher Energy'/'Photo Energy'. Spells can do a variety of things such as allowing the player to draw cards, add more shields to their shield zone, giving power or various breaker abilities to their creatures, or simply destroying opponents cards.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Cross Gears</b>: Cross Gear's are neither a creature nor a spell. Cross Gear's are put into the battle zone but cannot attack since it has no power. When you choose to 'cross' a Cross Gear onto a creature, you must pay the cost of the card again, and the 'crossed' creature gained this Cross Gear's ability. However when the creature is destroyed, the Cross Gear remains in the battle zone (as a sort of continuous equip card). There is no limit to the number of Cross Gears that can be crossed onto a creature, and the only way to remove Cross Gears from the battle zone is through effects specifically affect Cross Gears.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Evolution Cross Gears</b>: An Evolution Cross Gear is a type of Cross Gear that can only be played on a Cross Gear of a specified civilization. It has the same basic functionality as the Cross Gear, and if the Cross Gear used to evolve is initially crossed onto a creature, the Evolution Cross Gear will be automatically crossed onto the target creature. Each Evolution Cross Gear has 2 civilizations, as features 'catastrophe' in its card name.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Fortress</b>: Allows the player to 'cross' the fortress to a shield in a similar fashion as a Cross Gear. A fortress card gains its ability after it is attached to the shield while the shield is still in play, some later Fortresses protect the attached from being destroyed in exchange for other shield. Unlike Cross Gear's, Fortresses do not need to pay their mana cost twice like a Cross Gear and are 'equipped' onto the shields directly after being played. This type of card is introduced in DM-30 Ultra Duel. An example of a Fortress card in the Light Civilization is Silver Glory, Invincible Fortress.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Psychic Creature</b>:<sup><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></sup> Psychic Creatures are a card type first introduced in DM-36 Psychic Shock. A Psychic Creature is placed in the Hyperspatial Zone which is next to your graveyard. You are limited to 8 Psychic Creatures per hyperspatial zone and they are counted separately from your main deck of 40 or more cards. At anytime during a duel you are allowed to look at your opponents hyperspatial zone. A Psychic Creature card is two-sided, and features a creature on both sides. When the cheaper side creature activates its awaken ability, you may flip the card over to its higher cost side. This gives the creature a higher power and improved card effects. For example: Bolshack Dragon, the Temporal Blaze flips over to Bolshack Mobius, Victory Awakened when it wins a battle. A Psychic creature doesn't provides any mana as it can only ever be in your battle or dimensional zone, whenever a Psychic Creature is to leave the battle zone, it returns to the dimensional zone.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Psychic Evolution Creature</b>: These cards are put on top of Psychic creatures like Evolution creatures. They will be introduced in DM-39 Psychic Splash.</li></ul><h3><span>Card Rarity</span></h3><p>The symbol for a card's rarity is marked in the bottom right corner of the face-up side:</p><ul><li><b>Common:</b> a plain circle</li><li><b>Uncommon:</b> a diamond shape</li><li><b>Rare:</b> a star</li><li><b>Very Rare:</b> a circle with a star in the middle</li><li><b>Super Rare:</b> four squares put together to shape a diamond</li></ul><h3><span>List of Card Mechanics</span></h3><p>This is a list of the different Card Mechanics <sup><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></sup> or effects that a creature, spell, cross gear or fortress may have:</p><ul><li><b>Accelerator</b>: Allows a creature to use its Accelerator ability whenever it is crossed with a cross gear.

All Psychic Creatures have an Awaken ability.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Bio Kick</b>: Allows the player to discard the card from his hand whenever a creature of a certain race the player controls attacks and is not blocked.

It is possible to build a viable deck with one, two or even three civilizations. If used properly, the civilizations can complement each other nicely. Each of the civilizations has a zone which most cards of that civilization affect: Fire - Battle Zone, Light - Shield Zone, Nature - Mana Zone, Water - The Hand and Darkness - The Graveyard. The five civilizations are:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Civilizations</th><th>Representation</th></tr><tr><td><b>Water</b></td><td>Water element</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nature</b></td><td>Earth element</td></tr><tr><td><b>Light</b></td><td>Holy</td></tr><tr><td><b>Darkness</b></td><td>Unholy</td></tr><tr><td><b>Fire</b></td><td>Fire element</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><b>Water :</b> The Water Civilization is composed of sunken, technologically advanced cities.<sup><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></sup><ul><li><b>Races:</b> Blue Monsters, Cyber Clusters, Cyber Lords, Cyber Moons, Cyber Viruses, Deep Marines, Earth Eaters, Fish, Gel Fish, Leviathans, Liquid People, Merfolk, Poseidia Dragon, Sea Hackers, and Splash Queen.</li><li><b>Traits:</b> Water focuses on hand advantage (drawing cards), bounce (sending creatures back to the hand) and unblockables. Also features blockers, although not as good as most Light blockers. The disadvantage of water creatures is that the cost needed to summon usually are high and their power is usually low. Used correctly, water may be the best choice for a single civilization deck.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Nature :</b> The Nature Civilization is a beautiful world of never-ending lush greenery.<sup><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></sup><ul><li><b>Races:</b> Balloon Mushrooms, Beast Folk, Colony Beetles, Earth Dragons, Emerald Monsters, Gaia Command, Giant Insects, Giants, Horned Beasts, Mystery Totems, Snow Faeries, Tree Folk, Wild Veggies, and Wonder Tricks.</li><li><b>Traits:</b> Nature focuses on mana manipulation e.g.: increasing your own mana and destroying the opponents mana, power attackers, creature searching and rushing weenies (cheap and weak, but numerous creatures used to overrun enemy). Nature possesses one pure Nature Blocker, [Super Divine Star Bigbang Anastathis] but multiple multi-civilization blockers which are always part-light like [Sanfist, the Savage Vizier]. Nature features lots of powerful creatures and are of high-medium cost of mana.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Light :</b> The Light Civilization is located high among the clouds in celestial structures which is a extremely highly technologically and magically advanced.<sup><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></sup><ul><li><b>Races:</b> Angel Commands, Apollonia Dragons, Berserkers, Cosmo Walkers, Gladiators, Guardians, Initiates, Light Bringers, Mecha Del Sols, Mecha Thunders, Rainbow Phantoms, Shine Monsters, Soltroopers, and Starlight Trees.</li><li><b>Traits:</b> Light possesses the best blockers and focuses on shield generation, spell tutoring (searching from deck or recovering from graveyard or mana zone) and tapping and untapping creatures. Light is the civilization that has the least side-effects. Their evolutions are usually of average mana cost and has many high-power blockers in it that possess many useful effects such as double breakers or untapping it after it blocks or at the end of the turn. Exclusive to Light are creatures that can not be the target of an effect that requires a player to choose, for example [Warlord Alizonus] cannot be affected by spells like [Spiral Gate].</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Darkness :</b> The Darkness Civilization is located underground, with an evil and poisoned landscape.<sup><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></sup><ul><li><b>Races:</b> Brain Jackers, Chimeras, Dark Lords, Dark Monsters, Death Puppets, Demon Commands, Devil Masks, Dragon Zombies, Gargoyles, Ghosts, Hedrians, Living Dead, Pandora's Box, Parasite Worms, and Zombie Dragons.</li><li><b>Traits:</b> Darkness focuses on hand destruction, creature destruction and slayers. Darkness has many powerful creatures, including blockers, but the cards usually possess negative side-effects so they are considered by some to be the best choice for a deck featuring only one civilization.This type of decks are very useful for those who know how to use its effects well.It has the same standard as light but instead of focusing on shields it focus more on destroying.Light and darkness makes good combination for a deck.Cards like (King Acardias)is very useful for that type of decks.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Fire :</b> The Fire Civilization is located in a volcanic and battle-torn land ruled by those with the most power.<sup><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></sup><ul><li><b>Races:</b> Armored Dragons, Armored Wyvern's, Armorloid's, Big Muscles, Dragonoid's, Dune Geckos, Fire Birds, Featheroid's, Flame Commands, Humans, Machine Eaters, Melt Warriors, Rock Beasts, Volcano Dragons, and Xenopart's.</li><li><b>Traits:</b> Fire focuses on rushing, speed attacking (allows creatures to attack the same turn that they are summoned), mana destruction and creature destruction with power limits (for example: destroy a creature with 3000 power or less). Fire only possesses Multi-civilization blockers (which are always part light) blockers. Fire possess many powerful creatures and double breakers, thus making them one of the more unusual civilizations.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Rainbow:</b> Since DM-10 Shockwaves of the Shattered Rainbow, multi-colored (or Rainbow) cards were introduced. These contain cards that feature between 2 or 5 civilizations, while also gaining additional races or sharing effects. There are multiple races exclusive to Rainbow, Creator's, Lost Crusader's, Naga's, Pegagus', Soul Command's, Starnoid's, Spirit Quartz, World Bird's, World Command or World Dragon's.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Others:</b> There are also some cards in Japanese Duel Masters that are of a different civilization that they are supposed to, for example, Aqua Holy is a Pure Light Liquid People. This means that races are not always restricted to one civilization.</li></ul><h2 id='duel-masters-card-maker-pc-games'>Duel Masters Card Maker Pc Games</h2><p>There are many races belonging to more than one civilization, including Alien, Arc Seraphim, Brave Spirit, Creator, Deep Marine, Dreammate, Dynamo, Great Mecha King, Grand Devil, God, Lost Crusader, Lunatic Emperor, Luna's Sun Kaiser, Machine Hero, Origin, Phoenix, Saint Head, Shinobi, Survivor, Tyranno Drake and Vehicle Bee.</p><h2 id='duel-masters-card-maker-pc-game'>Duel Masters Card Maker Pc Game</h2><h2><span>References</span></h2><h2 id='duel-masters-card-maker'>Duel Masters Card Maker</h2><ol><li><b>^</b>http://www.wizards.com/Company/Brands/DuelMasters.aspx</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Kaijudo</li><li><b>^</b>http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/rules/glossary</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Psychic_Creature</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Mechanics</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Mechanics#.22Breaker.22_Variants</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Duel_Masters_TCG_Sets</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Duel_Masters_OCG_Sets</li><li><b>^</b>http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Civilization</li><li>^ <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup>World of Duel Masters</li></ol><h2><span>External links</span></h2><ul><li>Wizards of the Coast <i>Duel Masters</i> site : Official English <i>Duel Masters</i> site.</li><li>Takara-Tomy : Official Japanese <i>Duel Masters</i> website</li><li>CCGDB.com : Duelmasters CCG Search Engine, only site with both English DM-1 through 12, and Japanese DM-13 through the current release.
