The process is very simple for you. Once we have your vehicle and mod info, you will receive a custom base map that is specific to your vehicle and mods. With each calibration that is sent you will also get some basic instructions on a few datalogs that need to be taken with each calibration file. This process should be fun, so enjoy the tuning process! Don't stress out if the datalogs aren't perfect.</p><p>Once we see the datalogs, we will analyze the data provided by the PCM (powertrain control module) and the advanced sensors that are on the vehicle. With this data we can see exactly what the vehicle is doing and how it is performing and start making the necessary changes to dial in the car. Once the next calibration is ready, you will receive an email with the analysis, and a new map to flash the PCM with and some new instructions on datalogs that are needed. Then we rinse and repeat until the car is completely dialed in!</p><p><span>*</span><span>*Under no circumstances are refunds granted once the base calibration is made and sent via email </span></p><p>Please enter a serial number and click the submit button.
