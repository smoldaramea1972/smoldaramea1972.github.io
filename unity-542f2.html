Users who do not meet this requirement need to purchase a Pro or Plus subscription, which also offers advanced support features.<br><strong>Also Available: Download Unity for Mac</strong><br></div><h2>Release notes</h2><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>XboxOne: The default update granularity used by XDK's makepkg tool has changed to File granularity rather than Chunk granularity. There is now a setting to control this:<ul><li>Player Settings &gt; Xbox One &gt; Microsoft Xbox One Package Settings &gt; Update Granularity. This property is set to File by default. Chunk is recommended only for games that have already been released using the Chunk granularity, which was the default prior to this build. </li></ul></li></ul><h3>Improvements</h3><h3 id='unity-542f2-download'>Unity 5.4.2f2 Download</h3><ul><li>Editor: Added Android 5.0 and 5.1 to 'Minimum API Level' list.</li><li>GI: Don't add lights to Enlighten at runtime if they don't contribute to GI (bounce intensity at 0).</li><li>GI: Made pig assert message human readable.</li><li>iOS: Enabled thumb instruction support for IL2CPP ARMv7 slice.

This will be a performance gain in most cases by avoiding thread context switches.</li></ul><h3>Changes</h3><ul><li>Android: Added support for real 16bit DisplayBuffer. It can only be enabled in PlayerSettings, Handheld.use32BitDisplayBuffer is deprecated.</li><li>Scripting: GizmoType enum has changed (and is updated by automatic script updater).
